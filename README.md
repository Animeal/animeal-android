Love to use kickstarter's android-oss [VM concept](https://github.com/kickstarter/native-docs/blob/master/vm-structure.md).  

# About Enum Type
Still working with enum type classes replacement with `AutoValue`ed data classes.  
Got an idea from [A enum replacement](https://gist.github.com/mitchwongho/4a8cb9046e2304b1811f)

It was hard to fit working progress with given schedule.  
And also, look at the repository's name. It's for exhibit and still WIP.
